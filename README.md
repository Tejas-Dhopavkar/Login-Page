## Login-Page

This repository contains the code for the front-end of a login page. The page uses React for managing the components and Tailwind CSS for styling.

# Features

-- Different components are rendered on the click of a button. This is done with the help of react hooks, specifically the useState hook. 


-- This Login Page utilizes the concept of reusability. It uses the "map" function of javascript to display the links of the Navbar, the list of icons and the lists of features, sectors, resources & company in the Footer.
